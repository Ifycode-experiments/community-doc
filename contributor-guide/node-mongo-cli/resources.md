# node-mongo-cli resources

A number of resources have been put together to help understand the project (as is the case with [first task](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli/issues/1)), or have an understanding of the sources that the existing code came from - see [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-docs/issues/3) too.

Feel free to use other materials **alongside** these. You can also [suggest good resource materials](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli/issues/6) for other aspects of the project that you don't find a resource for in the documentation.
