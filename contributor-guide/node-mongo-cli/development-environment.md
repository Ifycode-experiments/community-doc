# node-mongo-cli development

## Development environment
Jasmine and eslint have already been set up and automated for development purpose. After cloning your fork on to your computer as explained in the ***[git workflow page](https://github.com/code-collabo/docs/blob/main/contributor-guide/git-workflow.md)***, here's how to get your ***[node-mongo-cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli)*** development environment running:
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* To run **eslint**, use `npm start` or `npm start -s` .
* To run **jasmine tests**, use `npm test` or `npm test -s`.
_You can decide to open separate terminals for each while you work on the CLI in another terminal_.
