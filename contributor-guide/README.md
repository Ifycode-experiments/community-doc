# Development environment
Jasmine (CLI only) & eslint have already been set up and automated for development purpose. Below is the guide for working with our repos in dev mode.

**[less-css-helper-library](https://github.com/code-collabo/less-css-helper-library) repo**:
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Use `npm start` or `npm start -s` to start the project. This has been configured to transpile your less code into css code.

**[node-mongo-starter-kit](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-starter-kit) repo**:
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Use `npm start` or `npm start -s` to start the project.

**[node-mongo-cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli) repo**:
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* To run **eslint**, use `npm start` or `npm start -s` .
* To run **jasmine tests**, use `npm test` or `npm test -s`.
_You can decide to open separate terminals for each while you work on the CLI in another terminal_.
