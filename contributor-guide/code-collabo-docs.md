# code-collabo docs

[Our documentation's github repo](https://github.com/code-collabo/docs) is linked to [gitbook docs](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs-code-collabo/) through gitbook integrations. This means that the github repo and the gitbook docs are synchronized i.e. whatever changes made to the docs on github repo reflects in the the one on gitbook and vice versa. 

To contribute to the docs, you can send a pull request with your corrections through github, following the instructions in the [contribution guidelines](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs-code-collabo/contributing).
