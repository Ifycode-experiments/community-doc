# code-collabo docs

### Integration and development

[Our documentation's github repo](https://github.com/code-collabo/docs) is linked to [gitbook docs](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs-code-collabo/) through gitbook integrations. This means that the github repo and the gitbook docs are synchronized i.e. whatever changes made to the docs on github repo reflects in the one on gitbook and vice versa. 

To contribute to the docs, you can send a pull request with your corrections through github, following the instructions in the [contribution guidelines](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs-code-collabo/contributing). 

### Find pages in github repo during development

Links to pages in the documentation \(github or gitbook\) takes you to the gitbook version of the page, since it's nicer to read. Find links that will take you to the pages in the github repo in the [SUMMARY.md file](https://github.com/code-collabo/docs/blob/main/SUMMARY.md).
