# helper-library overview

The  [less-css-helper-library](https://github.com/code-collabo/less-css-helper-library) project is made up just one package at the moment and is built with nodejs, less and css. The helper library is made to help frontend developers who prefer do not like to use css frameworks out there, either because of the learning curve involved or they just prefer to write plain css themselves.
