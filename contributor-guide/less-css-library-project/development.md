# helper-library development

## Development environment

After cloning your fork on to your computer as explained in the [git workflow page](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/git-workflow), here's how to get your [less-css-helper-library](https://github.com/code-collabo/less-css-helper-library) development environment running:

* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Use `npm start` or `npm start -s` to start the project. This has been configured to transpile your less code into css code.

{% hint style="info" %}
Work has started on making the library more suitable for production using webpack, so this part of the documentation will be updated soon if needed.
{% endhint %}

## Making and testing changes

For now, see [article: quick, effective and efficient way to test your separately hosted css library on your client during development](https://dev-obiagba.hashnode.dev/quick-effective-and-efficient-way-to-test-your-separately-hosted-css-library-on-your-client-during-development-1) for how to make and test the changes you make to the library. Documentation will be updated soon.
