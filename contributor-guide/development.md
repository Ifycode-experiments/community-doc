# less-css-helper-library development

## Development environment

After cloning your fork on to your computer as explained in the [git workflow page](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/git-workflow), here's how to get your [less-css-helper-library](https://github.com/code-collabo/less-css-helper-library) development environment running:

* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Use `npm start` or `npm start -s` to start the project. This has been configured to transpile your less code into css code using _**nodemon**_.
