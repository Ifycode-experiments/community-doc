# node-mongo-cli development

## Development environment
Jasmine and eslint have already been set up and automated for development purpose. After cloning your fork on to your computer as explained in the [git workflow page](https://github.com/code-collabo/docs/blob/main/contributor-guide/git-workflow.md), here's how to get your [node-mongo-cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli) development environment running:
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* To run **eslint**, use `npm start` or `npm start -s` .
* To run **jasmine tests**, use `npm test` or `npm test -s`.
_You can decide to open separate terminals for each while you work on the CLI in another terminal_.

## Commands and test cases

There are 3 templates - `es6`, `cjs`, `ts-es6`. The `es6` template is the default template. A folder is automatically created from your entry, and automatically downloads the template files too. 

Run the following commands to test:
* `node-mongo`
* `node-mongo cjs-folder cjs`
* `node-mongo ts-folder ts-es6`
* `node-mongo other java`

## Flags and test cases
`-i` is alias for `--intstall`, `-g` is alias for `--git`, `-s` is alias for `--skip-intstall`, `-x` is alias for `--skip-git`, `-y` is alias for `--yes`. You can use any of these to test the commands below.

Commands that work alike have been grouped together below. Run the following commands to test:
##
* `node-mongo a1`
* `node-mongo a2 -i -g`
##
* `node-mongo a3 -s`
* `node-mongo a4 -s -g`
##
* `node-mongo a5 -s -x`
* `node-mongo a6 -y`
