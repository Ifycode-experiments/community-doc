# Starter kit development

## Development environment

Eslint has already been set up and automated for development purpose. Babel also \(for transpiling the es6 template of the starter kit\). After cloning your fork on to your computer as explained in the [git workflow page](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/git-workflow), here's how to get your [node-mongo-esm-kit](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-esm-kit) or [node-mongo-cjs-kit](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cjs-kit) development environment running:

* Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Use `npm start` or `npm start -s` to start the project.

## Installed mongoDB and atlas options

There are two options - `installed MongoDB` option and `MongoDB ATLAS` option. To setup successful connection for whichever option you wish to use for your project, follow the guide written in yellow, which comes up after `Server running at http://localhost:3000` and `Error in DB connection` message in the console.
