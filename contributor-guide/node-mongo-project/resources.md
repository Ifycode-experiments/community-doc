# Project resources

A number of resources have been put together to help understand the project \(as is the case with [first task](https://github.com/code-collabo/docs/blob/main/contributor-guide/node-mongo-project/first-task.md)\), or have an understanding of the sources where the idea used to write the base code came from.

Feel free to use other materials alongside these. You can also [suggest good resource materials](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli/issues/6) for aspects of the project that you don't find a resource for in the documentation.
