# First Task ðŸ“Œ

The task is simple.

* Watch the 15 minutes long [How to build a CLI with Node.js](https://youtu.be/s2h28p4s-Xs) YouTube tutorial. 
* Code along. You don't have to build anything new, just follow the tutorial as it is. Have fun doing so.
* Push your code to github. Make sure to use code versioning to document your progress. **Please do not fork or clone this repo yet. Do the assignment in your own github account**.

ðŸ˜Œ Fun fact: You don't even have to understand fully what the instructor was doing.

| You are new to making a cli package? |

| No worries. Just show interest by finishing and submitting the task as instructed. Reach out to _**@Ifycode**_ incase you run into any issues. |
