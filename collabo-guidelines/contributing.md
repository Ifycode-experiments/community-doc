# Contribution guidelines

{% hint style="info" %}
Contributors can either fix issues in already existing projects or add/suggest a new project. Join the _**contribution support**_ channel on [Gitter](https://matrix.to/#/#code-collabo-foss-community:gitter.im) to interact with other contributors, in case you need help or have questions.
{% endhint %}

## General guidelines

* Interested contributors are to show interest by commenting on the issue they want to work on, in other to get assigned to the issue.&#x20;
  * Submitting a pull request for an issue you are not assigned to will only be counted as spam.
  * Try to submit a pull request for an issue within 2 days of showing interest, even if you are not through fixing the issue.
* Pull request title must reflect the Issue title you are working on, and it should start with "Fix: ". For example, If the issue title is "Add contribution rules section", the pull request title should be "Fix: Add contribution rules section".
* Pull requests should be linked to the issue it aims to fix.
* Feel free to ask questions if you are not clear about something in the issue you are working on.
