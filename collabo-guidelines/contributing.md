  * Try to submit a pull request for an issue within 2 days of showing interest, even if you are not through fixing the issue.
* Pull request title must reflect the Issue title you are working on, and it should start with "Fix: ". For example, If the issue title is "Add contribution rules section", the pull request title should be "Fix: Add contribution rules section".
