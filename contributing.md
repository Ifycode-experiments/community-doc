## General guidelines for Code Collabo project repos

First check to see if a project's repo has a **develop branch**. If the project's repo has a develop branch, then create your **feature branch** from the develop develop. If there is no develop branch, then create your feature branch from the **main branch**. Do not make changes directly in the main branch or the develop branch. See [git workflow](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/git-workflow) for explanation of these terms, how to make changes to the code base and submit pull request.

## List of contributors

We appreciate all our contributors who contribute to any aspect of the Code Collabo project, both those who touch code and those who don't. For now, contributors to any of Code Collabo's projects are listed only on in the [all-contributors.md](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/meet-our-awesome-contributors/all-contributors) which is in the docs repo. As the number of contributors increase over time, there will also be separate contributor.md files in each repo. We try our best to add contributors immediately, but incase you have contributed and don't find your name in the list please let us know so that you can be added.
