Thank you for... Add complete info here. 

## Contributing to our projects

You can contribute in any of these areas: `nodejs development`, `mongoDB development`, `unit testing`, `documentation` & `research`. 

Contributing guide is different depending on the project you are working on.

Please go through this general guidelines and the one specific to the particular project(s) you've chosen to work on, before you start contributing to any of Code Collabo's projects.

### General (all repos)
* Do not make changes directly in the `main` or `develop` branches. See [git workflow](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-docs/issues/2) on how to make changes to the code base and submit pull request.

### node-mongo project
* Completing the [first task assignment](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli/issues/1#issuecomment-785559734) is compulsory, if you are interested in working on issues with `cli-only` label or `starter-kit-only` label.
* Do not submit a pull request for an issue you have not been assigned to. Leave a comment under the issue you wish to work on and wait for approval before you start working on the issue. See [contribution & community guidelines](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-docs/issues/3) for complete details.


Feel free to ask questions concerning anything not clear on this topic if you have any. Just [ask your question(s) in the comment here](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli/issues/29), or in the comment under the issue you wish to work on and you'll be attended to.

_Tag **@Ifycode** in the comment, otherwise she won't receive a notification and therefore may not know that you wrote._
