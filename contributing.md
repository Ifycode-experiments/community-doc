# Contribution guidelines

Thank you for your interest in Code Collabo. We welcome and encourage anyone with any level of experience to contribute to any or all aspects of Code Collabo's projects. You can contribute in any of these areas: nodejs development, mongoDB development, testing, documentation & research.

{% hint style="info" %}
Contribution guideline is different depending on the project you are working on.
{% endhint %}

Please go through the general guidelines below and the one specific to the particular project\(s\) you've chosen to work on, before you start contributing to any of Code Collabo's projects.

### General guidelines for all repos

* If a repo has a `develop` branch, create your `feature branch` from develop. If there's no develop branch then create it from the `main` branch. Do not make changes directly in the `main` or `develop` branches. See [git workflow](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/git-workflow) for explanation of these terms, how to make changes to the code base and submit pull request.
* Feel free to ask questions in the comment there in the issue you wish to tackle - concerning anything not clear after you have read the general guide, and guide specific to the project\(s\) you want to work on.

_Tag_ [@Ifycode](https://github.com/Ifycode) _in the comment, otherwise she won't receive a notification and therefore may not know that you wrote._

### Documentation

If you find issues with any part of the documentation - [gitbook](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/) or [github](https://github.com/code-collabo/docs), you can report the issue. You will be asked to help work on it or it will be assigned to someone else \(if you don't have time\).

* You can [report or find issues to work on here](https://github.com/code-collabo/docs/issues).

### less-css-helper-library repo

If you find that some frequently used in-built css styles are not yet included in the library, you can raise it as an issue or send a pull request. Please take note of the following while contributing to the [less-css-helper-library](https://github.com/code-collabo/less-css-helper-library) repo:

* Group property-value pairs that are related or are often used together in one class so that it is reusable.
* The styles or classes \(names\) you propose must give good idea of the property-value pairs stored in it. 
* Styles or classes proposed must be usable in any section inside the body of an html document.
* You can [report or find issues to work on here](https://github.com/code-collabo/less-css-helper-library/issues).

### node-mongo project repos

The following repos make up the[ node-mongo](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/node-mongo-project) project: [node-mongo-cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli), [node-mongo-starter-kit](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-starter-kit) and [node-mongo-starter-cjs](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-starter-cjs). These contributing guidelines are specific to the node-mongo project repos:

* Completing the [first task assignment](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/node-mongo-project/first-task) is compulsory, for contributors that are interested in working on \(i.e. submitting or reviewing code for\) issues with `cli-only` label or `starter-kit-only` label.
* Do not submit a pull request for an issue you have not been assigned to. Leave a comment under the issue you wish to work on and wait for approval before you start working on the issue. 
* You can [report or find issues to work on here](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli/issues).

## List of contributors

We appreciate all our contributors who contribute to any aspect of the Code Collabo project, both those who touch code and those who don't. Contributors are listed on the readme of the repo\(s\) they contributed to, following the [all contributors spec](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/specification). As the number of contributors increase over time, the list will be moved to separate contributor.md files.
