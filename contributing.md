# Contribution guidelines

Thank you for your interest in Code Collabo. We welcome and encourage anyone with any level of experience to contribute to any or all aspects of Code Collabo's projects. You can contribute in any of these areas: nodejs development, mongoDB development, testing, documentation and research.

{% hint style="info" %}
Contribution guideline is different depending on the project you are working on.
{% endhint %}

Please go through the general guidelines below and the one specific to the particular project\(s\) you've chosen to work on, before you start contributing to any of Code Collabo's projects.

### General guidelines for all repos

* If a repo has a `develop` branch, create your `feature branch` from develop. If there's no develop branch then create it from the `main` branch. Do not make changes directly in the `main` or `develop` branches. See [git workflow](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/contributor-guide/git-workflow) for explanation of these terms, how to make changes to the code base and submit pull request.
* Feel free to ask questions in the comment there in the issue you wish to tackle - concerning anything not clear after you have read the general guide, and guide specific to the project\(s\) you want to work on.

{% hint style="info" %}
Tag [@Ifycode](https://github.com/Ifycode) in the comment of the issue you wish to work on, otherwise she won't receive a notification and therefore may not know that you wrote.
{% endhint %}

## List of contributors

We appreciate all our contributors who contribute to any aspect of the Code Collabo project, both those who touch code and those who don't. For now, contributors to any of Code Collabo's projects are listed only on in the  [all-contributors.md](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/docs/meet-our-awesome-contributors/all-contributors) which is in the docs repo. As the number of contributors increase over time, there will also be separate contributor.md files in each repo. We try our best to add contributors immediately, but incase you have contributed and don't find your name in the list please let us know so that you can be added.
